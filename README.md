To build it, solder some diodes with the black line facing the square pad, then solder some choc switches, then solder a pro micro with the TX pin matching the square pad. Extract the firmware and plop it over into qmk_firmware/keyboards, compile and test the keyboard, then make your own keymap and off you go!
